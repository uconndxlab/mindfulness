Federal Resources: Some federal agencies offer resources for identifying health care providers and help in finding low-cost health services.

SAMHSA also has a Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator (https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) on its website that can be searched by location. · Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) (https://www.hrsa.gov/): HRSA works to improve access to health care. The HRSA website has information on finding affordable healthcare, including health centers that offer care on a sliding fee scale. · Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (https://www.cms.gov/): CMS has information on its website about benefits and eligibility for mental health programs and how to enroll. · The National Library of Medicine (NLM) MedlinePlus (https://medlineplus.gov/): NLM’s website has directories(https://medlineplus.gov/directories/) and lists of organizations(https://medlineplus.gov/organizations/all_organizations.html) that can help in identifying a health practitioner. State and County Agencies: The website of your state or county government may have information about health services in your area. You may be able to find this information by visiting their websites and searching for the health services department. Insurance Companies: If you have health insurance, a representative of your insurance company will know which local providers are covered by your insurance plan. The websites of many health insurance companies have searchable databases that allow you to find a participating practitioner in your area. University, College, or Medical Schools: Your local college, university, or medical school may offer treatment options. To find these, try searching on the website of local university health centers for their psychiatry, psychology, counseling, or social work departments"
