Here is what two parents said:<br>\"I have to admit, I didn’t like the body scan at first. It felt boring and like I wasn’t getting anywhere. But after sticking with it for two weeks, I started noticing subtle changes—I was less tense, more patient, and even slept better. It took time, but now I look forward to those quiet minutes each day to reconnect with myself through a body scan.\"<br>\"Honestly, I found the body scan frustrating at first. I kept getting distracted, and it felt like a waste of time. But I decided to keep going, and gradually, I started feeling more in tune with my body and emotions. Now, it’s my go-to stress reliever, especially in the morning before a long day of work and parenting.\"</span>",
