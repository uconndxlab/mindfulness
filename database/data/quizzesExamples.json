When you have a 15-minute stretch, we recommend you do all the activities at once. Then, use any extra time during the day to practice them again, instead of moving on to the next day's activities.

We know that if you set goals for every day, you are more likely to do well and learn the skills. What do you do when you need to take a break? Is there something you can do less of so you can spend 5 minutes or more on this program to reach your goal? Look at your calendar and think about how you spend your time each day.
